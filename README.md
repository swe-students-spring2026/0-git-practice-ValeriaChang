## Learnings from two years of using AI tools for software engineering
**Article:** https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/two-years-of-using-ai

## Reflection
I chose this article because it discusses real world experiences using AI tools in software engineering over an extended period of time, rather than just making bold claims about AI replacing developers. It explains how AI tools have evolved from simple autocomplete assistants into more context aware collaborators, and how engineers have had to adapt their workflows to use them effectively. One key takeaway is that success with AI tools depends heavily on the developer’s ability to provide good context, evaluate outputs critically, and decide when human judgment is still necessary. Reading this article helped me feel less anxious about the future of computer science careers. While AI can significantly speed up tasks like writing boilerplate code, exploring unfamiliar codebases, or generating test cases, it still lacks a deep understanding of long term system design, product decisions, and trade-offs between different technical approaches. This showed me that software engineers are not becoming obsolete. Instead, our role is shifting toward guiding, reviewing, and collaborating with AI tools. Because of this, I want to focus on building skills such as system design, problem solving, and understanding user needs. I also see the importance of learning how to use AI tools effectively and responsibly, since that will likely be a core part of software development in the future. Rather than fearing AI, I now see it as a powerful tool that I should start mastering early in my career.
